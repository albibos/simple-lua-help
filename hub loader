-- A very simple way of this, i will make an advanced version when i make cooler-lua-help

if game.PlaceId == "targetgameid" then
  loadstring(game:HttpGet("raw script site"))()
elseif game.PlaceId == "targetgameid" then
  loadstring(game:HttpGet("raw script site"))() -- only do the elseif and below if you have multiple games!
end
-- you can then repeat this
