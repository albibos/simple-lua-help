--[[
touchinterest are what allow an item such as orbs to be collected via the player touching it. 
gladly, we have something called firetouchinterest. 
this is best utilized by an in pairs loop. see below for example!
--]]

local playerPart = game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Head -- this will "touch" the part

while wait() do
for i, v in pairs(game:GetService("Workspace"):GetDescendants()) do -- checks for all touchinterest under workspace
    if v.Name == "TouchInterest" and v.Parent then
        firetouchinterest(playerPart, v.Parent, 0) -- fires touchinterest
        wait(0.1)
        firetouchinterest(playerPart, v.Parent, 1) -- fires touchinterest
        end
end
end
