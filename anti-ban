so, some games have scripts named "ModList", "AdminList" etc.
copy all userID from this/these script and do what I do below.

	local AdminList = {
    userid,
    userid2,
    userid3,
    userid4,
    userid5 -- there can be as many userid as you need.
}
game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
    for i, v in pairs(AdminList) do
        if player.UserId == v then
game:GetService("Players").LocalPlayer:Kick("Anti-Ban kicked you. Reason: Game Staff Member/Moderator joined current server.") -- change text to whatever!
